    <h2>Hello! My name is Albert Yeh.</h2>

    <p>I'm a recent graduate from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am an aspiring game developer, but I also want experience in all software development positions as well.</p>

    <p>While learning computer science in university, I developed a strong foundation and passion for computer science. I've demonstrated the understanding of computer technology principles and skills in many fields such as security, distributed systems, human-computer interaction, game development, AI, and more, through coursework and projects.</p>

    <p>I have experience working as a former mentor for the UW Allen School of Computer Science and Engineeringâ€™s Diversity and Access program, where my team and I led a course for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and taught skills for students to be successful within the field of computer science.</p>

    <p>I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to the software development industry, so feel free to reach out about anything!</p>
