# Hello!
My name is Albert Yeh, a recent graduate from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am an aspiring game developer, but I also want experience in all software development positions as well. I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to the software development industry, so feel free to reach out about anything!
