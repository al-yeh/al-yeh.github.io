# Hello!
I am a computer science graduate from the University of Washington with experience in game development, computer graphics, and computer vision. I’ve built projects ranging from my senior capstone game with 4,000+ players, to personal projects that use technologies like OpenCV, ray tracing in Unity, and react native, and I enjoy combining technical problem-solving with creative design. I am passionate about mentorship, teamwork, and building software that engages and inspires.
