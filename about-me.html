      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm a recent grad from the University of Washington; born, raised, and currently living a couple cities away from Seattle, WA. At UW, I had the pleasure of working as a mentor for the Allen School Scholars Program where I helped teach and mentor freshmen going into the computer science & engineering program at the UW.</p>

      <p>As a senior capstone, I chose game development; a passion of mine since I was a kid. In the capstone, I had the opportunity to create a video game with two others (more about that in my projects page), only bolstering my interest in game development and my interest in the field of computer science as a whole.</p>

      <p>In my offtime, my hobbies include hiking, playing video games (as you might have guessed! Some favorites include Warframe, Ultrakill, and Outer Wilds), bouldering, and 3d printing! Here's some photos:</p>
